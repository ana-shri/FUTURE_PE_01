“Letting AI Run My Life for a Day: Productivity Hack or Chaos?”

This project showcases a complete AI-driven YouTube content creation workflow, where multiple AI tools were used to plan, script, design, and assemble a full YouTube video. The video explores what happens when an engineering student lets ChatGPT control their entire day — including meals, productivity sessions, workouts, and even social interactions.

The goal of this project was to replicate how modern creators and marketers use AI to speed up content creation while maintaining storytelling, humor, and personal style.
